        <h2 align = 'center'>All about me!</h2>
        <p align = 'center'> My name is Brandon Johnson. I am 23 years old and I am not from the Seattle area. <br>
        I am originally from Florida I grew up there and spent about 16 years of my life there. <br> 
        I've lived in Washington for about 6 or 7 years? Not to sure on that one. 
        But I grew to love the city and the people very fast. <br> 
        Shortly after moving here I discovered my love of technology and computer science.<br>
        Seeing all the tech giants in one place was very inspiring, I wanted to be apart of that lifestyle. <br>
        With this new found inspiration I started looking for learning opertunities everywhere. <br>
        One of the first things was taking apart the home computer and breaking things all over the house. <br>
        That soon lead me on the path of software and coding. I started out small by modding games. <br>
        but soon went into writing small bits of code and little scripts for my favorite game series Fallout. <br>
        This was pretty fun but I always wanted more it just wasnt enough. I went out looking for new oppurtunities and found someone. <br>
        I was lucky enough to be introduced to one of the IT workers at my Mothers's company and he took me under his wing and started to mentor me. <br>
        With this new person mentoring me I was able to open up my scope of possibilites. I started learning to code small bits here and there. <br>
        I started with C++ and quickly moved onto python. I skipped around alot and looking back I wish I wouldnt have. <br>
        This was a recurring theme all through highschool and it only really stopped after I started my first year of college.<br>
        Once college started I was convinced that I wanted to be a game designer. But that was not the right choice.<br>
        Game design is fun in theory but not so much in practice at least for me. Moving on from that took a few years. <br>
        Eventually I realised that a more general less specialized background in code was right for me.<br>
        With some more practice on the side and taking care of some finacial issues I started looking and asking in my network about schools. <br>
        I was told about CodeFellows and now Im here! Im ready to start a new chapter in my life and Im excited to see it through.</p>
